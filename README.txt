#Dunocoin-Exploit.

- A custom miner that fakes packets to be considered an IoT device and earn more coins.

# How does it work?
Duno coin is a cryptocurrency that can be mined on IoT devices like: Arduinos, ESPs, Raspberry Pis etc...
A PC miner with high H/S got a small amount of coins but a crappy hardware got a ton. The server knows your hardware by your H/S count.
The Raspberry PI4 can do 5Mh/s, and my pc with RTX 3060ti does 230Mh/s but gains NOTHING!!!

So when you submit a found hash, you send your hashrate in your payload :
  - Exploitation is simple: Just change your hashrate to a crappy hashrate but in reality you make a large amount of hash/s. and then you earn a lot of coins :p

--------------------------------------------------------------------

def submit_hash(self, result: str, hashrate: str) -> bool:
    self.socket.send(bytes(f'{result},{hashrate},PuffMiner', encoding='utf-8'))
    return True if self.socket.recv(1024).decode().rstrip("\n") == 'GOOD' else False

just call "submit_hash(result, "100")" or amount of you whant :p
