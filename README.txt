# Dunocoin-Exploit.

- Custom miner that Spoof packets to be considered an IoT device and earn more coins.

# How it work ?.
Duno coin is cryptocurrencie that can be mined on IoT device like: Arduinos, ESPs, Raspberry Pis  etc...
Pc miner with hight H/S got low amount of coins but shitty hardware got a tone.. Server know your hardware by the number of your H/s.
Raspberry PI4 can do 5Mh/s, and my pc with RTX 3060ti do 230Mh/s and earn NOTHING !!!

So, when you are submiting found hash, you are sending your hashrate on your payload:
  - Exploit is simple: Just change your hashrate by shit hashrate but in reality you do big amount of hash/s. and then earn lot of coins :p
